# 2022 Fantasy Football Draft Order Picker

This is a fun little app I created to determine the draft order for my fantasy football league. To keep track of my progress and remind myself what I still need to do, I'm going to keep track of my big-picture goals here.

### Pre-Selection Features

- [ ] Page background image either NFL blue or just sort of grey nondescript background
- [ ] Main component background is football field green with white lines mimicking real life football field. This field grows or shrinks proportional to how many teams are entered in the league.
- [ ] A text input field allowing a user to input a team name, adding it to the list of teams in the league.
- [ ] A component which populates newly entered teams onto the football field, showing their name, possibly an image (randomly assigned most likely, from a list of generic football images), and a randomly assigned colored bar, which starts at the zero yard line on the left-hand side of the field. Teams can be removed by clicking their names on the field.
- [ ] A button to begin the draft selection. When the button is pressed, users can no longer change teams (either through adding or subtracting), and the app moves to actual selection.
- [ ] Another button resets the entire app to the initial state.

### Selection Features

- [ ] Each team begins selection with 0 points.
- [ ] Every two to three seconds, teams (either one at a time or simultaneously) randomly select a number from within a certain range (probably 0-99), and point assignment happens based on the number selected.
- [ ] Based on real-world percentage of play outcomes, teams will either lose yards (not possible from the 0 yard line - no safeties!), go nowhere, make a small gain, or make a large gain. These outcomes are determined by the previously mentioned randomly selected number.
- [ ] A fun play-by-play at the bottom of the field gives a small amount of color commentary based on outcome.
- [ ] The player's colored bar updates to the appropriate yard line on screen to reflect the random outcome.
- [ ] The first player to reach 100 yards is awarded first pick in the draft. Second player has second pick, and so on.
- [ ] A helpful sidebar tracks team order.
- [ ] A button allows the user to stop the selection in progress, resetting all yards gained to zero. This returns the app status to pre-selection mode.

### Post-Selection Features

- [ ] The final selection order is displayed on screen.
- [ ] A button allows the user to return to pre-selection mode.
- [ ] EXTRA CREDIT: If I'm feeling really ambitious, I'll add a way to effectively screenshot the final draft order and save it to your computer's download folder. Probably not gonna happen though.
